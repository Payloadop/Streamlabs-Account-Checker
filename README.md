# Streamlabs Account Checker

A powerful and efficient multi-threaded Streamlabs account checker built using Python with support for proxies, logging, and robust error handling.

## Features
âœ… Multi-threaded for fast performance
âœ… Proxy support for anonymity and avoiding bans
âœ… Detailed logging with categorized console outputs
âœ… Automatically removes checked accounts
âœ… Captures linked platforms for valid accounts
âœ… Error handling with retry logic for failed attempts

## Requirements
- Python 3.11 or higher
- `tls_client` for secure TLS session management
- `console.py` for detailed and color-coded logs

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Payloadop/Streamlabs-Account-Checker.git
cd streamlabs-checker
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install tls-client
```

## Configuration

1. Add your accounts to `accs.txt` in the format:
```
email1@example.com:password123
email2@example.com:password456
```

2. Add your proxies to `proxies.txt` (one per line):
```
username:password@ip:port
username:password@ip:port
```

## Usage
To run the checker:
```bash
python main.py
```

## How It Works
1. The script loads accounts from `accs.txt`.
2. For each account:
   - A TLS client is created using `tls_client`.
   - The client retrieves the XSRF token and logs in.
   - If successful, the linked platforms are extracted and saved to `valid.txt`.
   - If invalid, the account is saved to `invalid.txt`.
3. Threads are used to process multiple accounts simultaneously.

## Output
- **Valid Accounts:** Stored in `valid.txt` with format: `email:password:linked_platforms`
- **Invalid Accounts:** Stored in `invalid.txt`
- **Console Logging:** Provides success, error, and warning messages in real-time

## Example Console Output
```
[info] Loaded 100 accounts. Running on 50 threads...
[success] [user1@example.com] Successfully Logged In!
[info] [user1@example.com] Saved to valid.txt -> Twitch, YouTube
[error] [user2@example.com] Failed login (Invalid credentials)
```

## Known Issues
- Some proxies may cause frequent retries; ensure your proxy list is clean.
- OAuth flow may sometimes fail if redirects are inconsistent.

## To-Do
- Implement automatic proxy rotation for better stability.
- Add rate-limiting management for improved success rates.
